# SoC25_AlgoNumT
This is a repository for the assignments solved during the SoC 2025. The main topic was Algorithmic number theory and algebra. My name is Ayaan Reuben Toppo, Roll no - 24B3302. Mentor - Nilabha Saha
We made a library that has functions that are used in cryptography using comcepts from number theory and algebra. A very common such function would be the function that determines whether a number is prime or not.
