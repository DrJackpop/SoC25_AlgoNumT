# SoC25_AlgoNumT
This is a repository for the assignments solved during the SoC 2025. The main topic was Algorithmic number theory and algebra. My name is Ayaan Reuben Toppo, Roll no - 24B3302. Mentor - Nilabha Saha
We made a library that has functions that are used in cryptography using comcepts from number theory and algebra. A few functions to mention are is_prime(), modular_sqrt(), factor() and other commonly used in number theory and algebra.
